# Windows10 Autounattend

This project is optimized for installation via an USB stick. All available Windows updates and Manufacturer specific drivers for Lenovo are installed automatically. Also various software packages can be installed automatically via chocolatey. They default account after the installation is `DeviceAdmin` with the password `password*`


## Process Flow
1. Check if an Internet connection is available
1. Download the `firststart.ps1` script
1. Execute the `firststart.ps1` script
   1. Install Windows Updates
   1. Install Hardware Manufacturer Updates

## Error Handling

If the error dialog is displayed after the installation and the computer hangs in a loop after confirming, this can be fixed with this trick.
1. When message appears, press `SHIFT` + `F10` to open `CMD`
1. Type: `regedit.exe`
1. Browse to `HKLM/SYSTEM/SETUP/STATUS/ChildCompletion` in `setup.exe`, change the value from 1 to 3.

## Create an USB Boot Device

To create a bootable USB stick I recommend one of the following tools. Ventoy has the advantage that several ISOs are available at the same time on a USB stick.

- Use [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy) with the `Auto Installation Plugin`
- Use this [Powershell script](https://github.com/vmware-samples/euc-samples/tree/master/Windows-Samples/Tools%20%26%20Utilities/Windows%2010%20Automated%20Setup%20Media) from VMware
